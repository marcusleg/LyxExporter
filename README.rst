LyxExporter
===========

This CLI utility assists you in keeping your PDFs exports of from the
`Lyx <http://www.lyx.org>`_ and Latex files up to date.

It scans a given directory for \*.lyx and/or \*.tex files and checks if their 
corresponding PDFs are present and up to date. If any PDFs are missing or outdated 
the user will be prompted with the choice to let the program export them.
